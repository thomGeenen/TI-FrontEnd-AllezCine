# 📲 🎥   IT Front-End Development exercise in pair programming 
For this exercise, we had to compose a pair to code a template that was provided to us.

The difficulty lay in our ability to reproduce a template in exactly the same way as the template designer.

## Pair programming a great experience 👬 😁

We also regularly had to use GitHub and handle any conflicts.

We had a set of instructions and we had to arrive at the final result after one week of programming
